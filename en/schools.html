      This page provides context about an ongoing exploration into how <strong>audio and storytelling without screens</strong>
      can support listening, language development and autonomy in <strong>Early Years and early primary education</strong>.

        My name is Alex Barrena. I work independently with schools and educational projects to explore
        simple, low-friction approaches to learning that fit naturally into classroom routines.
      </p>

      <p>
        The current focus is on <strong>audio storytelling</strong> as a pedagogical tool that can be used
        during moments such as story time, listening corners, calm periods or transitions,
        without introducing screens or additional complexity for teachers.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is <strong>not a sales initiative</strong> and does not involve promoting a specific product.
        The goal is purely to understand whether this type of approach is pedagogically relevant,
        and under what conditions it could make sense in practice.

        I’m currently speaking with a small number of schools to exchange perspectives and learn
        from their experience. If this topic is relevant to your educational context,
        I’d be happy to briefly connect or exchange views.
